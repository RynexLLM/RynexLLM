This update focuses on making the llm-chain more robust and versatile, allowing developers to build even more advanced applications with ease.\\n\\n### Major updates\\n\\n#### 1. The switch to the `tera` template language\\n\\nOne of the most significant changes in this release is the introduction of the `tera` template language. This powerful and flexible templating system enables developers to create dynamic and complex templates for their projects. The `tera` language allows for more advanced control structures and filters, making it a substantial upgrade from the previous templating system.\\n\\n#### 2. Improved prompt system\\n\\nAnother notable update is the revamped prompt system. With llm-chain v0.6.0, the prompt system now supports both Chat and completion-style models. This improvement means developers no longer need to worry about whether they are using a completion or chat model when crafting prompts. This unified approach simplifies the development process and makes it easier to work with various types of language models.\\n\\n#### 3. Updated LLaMA.cpp\\n\\nThe latest version of LLaMA.cpp has been integrated into this release, ensuring better performance and stability for your projects.\\n\\n### Other improvements\\n\\n#### 1. Safer error handling\\n\\nIn addition to the major updates, llm-chain v0.6.0 also brings improvements to error handling. Templates now return `Result` rather than panicking on errors, making it more convenient to handle any issues that may arise during development. Similarly, Executors also return `Result` instead of panicking on errors, providing a more consistent and safer API.\\n\\n### Time to move on from the old templating system\\n\\nWith the introduction of the `tera` template language, we strongly recommend moving away from the old templating system. This update provides a solid foundation for building even more advanced applications using the llm-chain library.\\n\\nWe hope you\'re as excited about these enhancements as we are! As always, we appreciate your feedback and support.

We will walk through a simple example that demonstrates how to generate responses using OpenAI\'s ChatGPT model.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nFirst, let\'s start by installing the necessary packages using `cargo add`. You will need the `llm-chain` and `llm-chain-openai` libraries:\\n\\n```sh\\ncargo add llm-chain llm-chain-openai\\n```\\n\\nNow, let\'s dive into the code:\\n\\n```rust\\n\\nuse llm_chain::{traits::StepExt, Parameters};\\nuse llm_chain_openai::chatgpt::{Executor, Model, Role, Step};\\n\\n#[tokio::main(flavor = \\"current_thread\\")]\\nasync fn main() {\\n    let exec = Executor::new_default();\\n    let chain = Step::new(\\n        Model::ChatGPT3_5Turbo,\\n        [\\n            (\\n                Role::System,\\n                \\"You are a helpful assistant\\",\\n            ),\\n            (Role::User, \\"Tell me about the Rust programming language\\"),\\n        ],\\n    )\\n    .to_chain();\\n    let res = chain.run(Parameters::new(), &exec).await.unwrap();\\n    println!(\\"{:?}\\", res);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the code snippet above, we begin by importing the necessary modules and functions from the `llm-chain` and `llm-chain-openai` libraries. We then define a simple `main` function that uses the `Executor` and `Step` structs to create a conversational chain.\\n\\nThe `Model::ChatGPT3_5Turbo` model is used as the language model in this example. We also define two steps in the conversation: the first one sets the role of the assistant and the second one asks a question about the Rust programming language.\\n\\nFinally, we execute the conversation chain using the `run` method and print the generated response.\\n\\n## Wrapping Up\\n\\nAs you can see, using ChatGPT in Rust with `llm-chain` is a straightforward and efficient process. The library makes it easy to build and manage conversational agents in Rust, allowing developers to focus on creating more powerful and interactive applications.\\n\\nTo continue learning about ChatGPT in Rust and how to make the most of the `llm-chain` library, try our [tutorial](https://chat.openai.com/docs/getting-started-tutorial/index) ."},{"id":"introducing-llm-chain","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/introducing-llm-chain","editUrl":"https://github.com/sobelio/llm-chain/tree/main/blog/blog/2023-04-10/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-10/index.md","title":"Unleashing the Power of Large Language Models with LLM-chain","description":"We\'re excited to announce the release of LLM-chain, a Rust library designed to help developers work with Large Language Models (LLMs) more effectively.
